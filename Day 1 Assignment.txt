Question 1. int a = 0;

for (i = 0; i < N; i++) 
{

for (j = N; j > i; j--) 
{

a = a + i + j;

}

}
Answer- Time complexity is O(N^2)

Question 2. Wha t is the time complexity of the following code?
int count = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i = i*2)
     {
         For (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)
           {
               count = count + 1;
           }  
      }

Answer- O(log(log n))

Question 3. Find the best case, average case and the worst case of linear Search Algorithm.

Answer- best case is O(1)
        average case is O(n/2)
        worst case is O(n)
